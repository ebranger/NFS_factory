This is a list of things that could be improved.

Better adjustment of tree size.

Check that the polynomials match the input number. At currently I assume that this check is done by the python driver.

Faster factorization of found relations. For now, just use the Pollard rho implementation from gnfs-lasieve.
If the relations factorization becomes really fast, consider storing only the (a,b) pair, and reconstruct the entire relation if it found to be smooth.

Improvements can be done to further save space in the binary relation format. 

Test rational side batch smoothness checking. I have used batch smoothness checking only on the algebraic side, mainly on degree-4 polynomials.

For smoothness checking on the algebraic side, include only factor-base primes in the prime product.
